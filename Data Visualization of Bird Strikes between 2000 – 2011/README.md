## About the DataSet
---
ransport and communication is one of the crucial domain in field of analytics.
Environmental impacts and safety are, nowadays, two major concerns of the scientific
community with respect to transport scenarios and to the ever-growing urban areas.
These issues gain more importance due to the increasing amount of vehicles and people.
Seeking for new solutions is reaching a point where available technologies and artificial
intelligence, especially MAS, are being recognized as ways to cope and tackle these
kinds of problems in a distributed and more appropriate way.
A bird strike is strictly defined as a collision between a bird and an aircraft which is in 
flight or on a take-off or landing roll. The term is often expanded to cover other wildlife 
strikes - with bats or ground animals. Bird Strike is common and can be a significant 
threat to aircraft safety. For smaller aircraft, significant damage may be caused to the 
aircraft structure and all aircraft, especially jet-engine ones, are vulnerable to the loss of 
thrust which can follow the ingestion of birds into engine air intakes. This has resulted in
several fatal accidents. Bird strikes may occur during any phase of flight, but are most 
likely during the take-off, initial climb, approach and landing phases due to the greater 
numbers of birds in flight at lower levels. To have a closer look the following document 
visually depicts the data collected on Bird Strikes by FAA between 2000-2011.

## Interesting task insights-
---
+ Total number of bird strikes happens is around __25.43__ thousand in the span.
+ In this span of 11 years more than __2400 Aircrafts__ got Damaged due to Bird
   Strikes and this resulted in the repair cost of __136 million dollar__ of aircrafts.
+ Out of 25,429 flights that have been involved in a bird strike incident,
   22,975 received no damage while 2454 received small to large scale
   damages.
+ Number of bird strikes continue to increase yearly from __2000 to 2011__.
   where in __2010__ the number of strikes is highest where as in year __2004__ the
   lowest number of Bird strikes happens.
+ Airlines namely, Business , Southwest Airlines , American Airlines, Delta
   Air Airlines, US Airlines are more involved in bird strikes than other
   airlines.
+  The state of California is involved with most number of bird strikes in all of
   the USA , followed by Taxes.
+ States like Montana received a comparatively low number of strikes
